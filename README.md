## Introduction
The Harris Central Appraisal District (HCAD) is responsible for discovering and appraising properties for tax purposes in Harris County. This project addresses the business problem of efficient property tax assessment and management by analyzing property characteristics and tax data, ensuring fair and accurate tax evaluations, and providing geospatial insights.

## Objectives
1. **Data Integration**: Combine and clean the 15 data tables into a single, comprehensive dataset.
2. **Descriptive Analysis**: Provide summary statistics and insights into property characteristics and tax data.
3. **Trend Analysis**: Identify trends in property values, tax assessments, and exemptions over time.
4. **Geospatial Visualization**: Create maps and visualizations to show the geographic distribution of property characteristics and tax assessments.

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes 15 data tables representing various aspects of property and tax information, such as account details, land use, structural elements, and exemptions. The data tables are associated through a 13-digit account number (`acct`) and are geocoded for spatial analysis.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Excel**: Initial data inspection and cleaning
- **SQL**: Data integration and further cleaning
- **Python**: Data analysis (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Looker Studio**: Data visualization and dashboard creation
